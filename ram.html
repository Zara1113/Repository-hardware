    <span class="pInfo"> RAM, stands for Random Access Memory. It is a type of computer memory that allows data to be accessed  randomly, meaning any byte of memory can be accessed without touching the preceding bytes. RAM is a volatile memory which means it loses it contents when the power is off.</span>

        There are several types of RAM which commonly used in computers and other electronic devices.
        <br>1. Dynamic Random Access Memory: (DRAM) is the most common type of RAM used in computers. It stores each bit of data in a seprate capacitor within a integrated circuit.
        <br>2. Static Random Access memory: (SRAM) is faster and more expensive than DRAM. It uses flip-flop circuits to store data, requiring no refreshing. SRAM is commonly used in cache memory.
        <br>3. Sychronous Dynamic Random Access Memory: (SDRAM) sychronizes the data transfers with the clock speed of teh CPU, allowing for faster data access comapred to a sychronous DRAM. It is commonly used in early laptops, desktops and computers. </span>

            Several typoes of RAM are used in gaming PCs:
            <br>1. DDR4 ADRAM: DDR4 RAM is currently the most common type of RAM used in gaming PCs. It offers high data transfer rates and capacities suitable for gaming appliances.
            <br>2. Higher Frequency RAM: RAM modules with higher frequencies, such as 3200MHz or 3600MHz, can provide faster data transfer rates, which can lead to smootehr gameplay and better performance.
            <br>3. Dual Channel or Quad Channel Configuartion: Many gaming motehrboards support dual-channel or quad-channel memory configurations, which allow for better memory bandwidth and performance.</span>
