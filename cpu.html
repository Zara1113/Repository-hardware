        There are several types of CPUs including:
        <br>1.General Purpose CPUs: These are versatile processors found in most computers, capable of handling a wide range of tasks.
        <br>2.Mobile CPUs: Designed for smartphones, tablets and other portable devices, these CPUs priotirize power effeciency and compact size.
        <br>3.Server CPUs: Optimized for handling heavy workloads in data centers and servers environments, emphasizing multi-core configurations and high throughout.

    <span class="pInfocpu"> For gaming, you generally want a CPU that offers  strong single-core performance since many games rely heavily on this aspect of CPU performance. A multicore CPU with high clock speeds is also advantageous for handling various tasks simultaneously while gaming, such as background processes and system overhead.</span>
