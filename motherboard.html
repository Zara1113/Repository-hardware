<p> A motherboard is the main circuit board in a computer taht holds crucial components such as the CPU, RAM, GPU and other peripherals.It provides teh electrical connections between these components and allows them to communicate with each other.Here are the some features of motherboard:
    <br>1.Circuit Board:The motherboard is the primary circuit board in a computer system, often referred to as the "heart" of teh system.
    <br>2.Expansion Slot:Motherboards feature expansion slots(PCLs, PCI etc.) to allow users to add additional functionality to their systems, such as graphics cards, sound cards, network cards, and other expansion cards.
    <br>3.Power Delivery:The motherboard regulates and distributes power to various componnets, ensuring they recieve teh correct voltage and current for operation.
    <br>4.Chipset:The chipset of a motherboard is a crucial componnet that manages communication between the CPU, RAM, storage devices, and other peripherals. It acts as the "traffic controller" for data flow within the system.
    <h3>Different RAM supported by Motherboards</h3>
    <br>Motherboard support different types of RAM. These are the following:
    <br>1.DDR (Double Data Rate): DDR RAM is a type of computer memory that is capable pf transferring data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal.This allows DDR RAM to effectively double the data transfer rate compared to its predecessor, Sychronous DRAM (SDRAM).DDR RAM has been succeedes by DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, and DDR5, each offering improvements in speed, effeciency, and capacity over its predecessors.
    <br>2.DDR4 (Double Data Rate 4):This is the latest standard of RAM and offers the highest performance.It is commonly supported by modern motherboards and available in various speeds and capacities.
    <br>3.DDR3 (Double Data Rate 3):Older than DDR4,DDR3 RAM is still used in some older systems. It has lower performance compared to DDR4 but may be supported by motherboards designed for older CPUs.
    <br>4.DDR2 (Double Data Rate 2):Even older than DDR3,DDR2 RAM is now mostly obsolete.Some very old systems may still support DDR2 RAM, but it is rare to find new motherboards that support it.
